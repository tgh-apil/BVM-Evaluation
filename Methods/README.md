***Figure 1: Test set-up.** Suction was connected directly to the patient port of the BVM device (without a face mask) and titrated to achieved target flow rates of 25 and 50 L/min. The negative pressure required to generate each target flow value was recorded in two conditions: expiratory port open or sealed. The CAREstream devices underwent additional testing with the secondary Flow/Pressure meter at the Expiratory port to quantify entrained flow through the faulty expiratory valves.*
