## Abstract
**Background** Bag-valve-mask (BVM) devices are critical equipment in acute care, and are used routinely during resuscitation, in operating rooms and intensive care units and during patient transport among numerous other settings. Unanticipated findings during an unrelated experiment involving BVMs suggested significant variations in the inspiratory resistance across different models and, more concerning, repeated failure of the valves in one brand in use at our hospital. 
**Methods** We evaluated inspiratory flow and resistance with open or blocked expiratory ports in 3 different models of BVM devices available at our hospital (3 samples of each model). 
**Results** All samples from two of the three models (Laerdal LSR and Ambu Spur II) showed anticipated behaviour with no effect of expiratory port blockage on inspiratory flow and resistance. All three samples of the third model, CARE-BVM (CAREstream Medical, Oakville, ON) showed consistent and significant increases in inspiratory flow resistance when the expiratory port was blocked. This suggested significant entrainment of outside air during inspiration, via a leaking expiratory valve. To confirm this we directly measured entrained air flow from the expiratory valve with simulated inspiratory flows of 25 and 50 L/min. Results showed that between 43-74% of inspiratory flow was entrained from the expiratory valve instead of flowing through the self-inflating reservoir of the BVM.
**Conclusion** Our results raise a significant safety concern regarding the performance of CARE-BVM devices suggesting that spontaneously breathing patients may often be receiving a significantly lower concentration of oxygen than assumed by care providers.
